Evaluation
==========

Evaluation tools and associated code used in the CAMI pipeline.

These tools are separated by evaluation type.

* Assembly -- tools which evaluate assembly results.
* Binning -- tools which evaulate taxonomic binning.
* Profiling -- tools which evaluate taxonomic profiling.

####File formats
Apart from assembly which works from traditional assembly output formats, Binning and Profiling require result files to be in the [CAMI file formats](https://github.com/CAMI-challenge/contest_information/tree/master/file_formats).

A validation tool has been provided, which end-users are encourage to use in testing their submissions for compliance.
